dynamic-load
============

A small script using JQuery to load pictures when they are shown on the screen.

## Usage

1. Include the script in your file (you should know how to do this by now - if not, learn HTML5 before continuing).
2. Use something like that

    <img src="" class="dynamic-load" data-src="/path/to/myimage.png" />

3. There is no step 3
